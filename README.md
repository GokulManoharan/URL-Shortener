# URL-Shortener
A node URL shortener app

## Description
This is a node servere that takes any URL as an input and converts that into a shortened version like how [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/)
does. This might be very useful when we want to paste some lengthy URL but we are allowed to paste only limited number of characters.

**Example**  
Input : "https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v9.x/api/perf_hooks.html"  
Output: "http://bit.ly/2tV7lGo"
